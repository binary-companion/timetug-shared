// swift-tools-version: 6.0
import PackageDescription

// The package the Mac app (and any Swift host) depends on by URL: product TimeTugKit, the Swift front door of the Rust engine.
// The sources live in swift/TimeTugKit/Sources (the package there is the one the tests and `swift-test.sh` use).
//
// On a branch the binary target is a path: build it with `scripts/dev/build-xcframework.sh`. A release tag points at a release
// commit in which scripts/release/write-swift-package.py replaced the path by the URL and checksum of the released XCFramework
// (AGENTS.md, "Releases and release commits").
