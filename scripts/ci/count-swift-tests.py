"""Counts the tests that a `swift test` log says were executed and fails when too few ran or any failed.
Usage: count-swift-tests.py LOG --minimum N [--minimum-runs R]

The Windows jobs use it because a green job must mean "the tests ran": a skipped target or an
unexpected zero would otherwise pass. It counts

  * Swift Testing: every `Test run with N tests ... passed|failed` summary line (one per test target);
  * XCTest: the `Executed N tests, with M failures` line under `Test Suite 'All tests'`, once per
    bundle (the same number is repeated under the .xctest suite, which is not counted again).

--minimum-runs R also requires R Swift Testing summaries (one per test target), so a target that
vanishes is noticed even when the remaining ones keep the total above the minimum.

It exits 1 when the total is zero or below the minimum, when a summary reports a failure, or when
the log cannot be read."""
